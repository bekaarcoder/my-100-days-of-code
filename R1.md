## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - Started 2018

### Day 1: February 27. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Coding daily from 2-3 days, but now started with this 100daysofcode journal. Was creating a Node JS notemaking app. Today, completed the app. Tomorrow, may be, I'll learn how to deploy this app to heroku.

**Thoughts:** I felt like to start this journal thing days ago, but now, starting this, it feels good.

### Day 2: February 28. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Fix some codes and validation error on my nodejs app. Connected the app with #mlab and deployed it to #heroku. Started to learn Passport google-oauth.

**Next Step:** Start a new nodejs project and implement passport-google-oauth.

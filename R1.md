## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - Started 2018

### Day 1: February 27. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Coding daily from 2-3 days, but now started with this 100daysofcode journal. Was creating a Node JS notemaking app. Today, completed the app. Tomorrow, may be, I'll learn how to deploy this app to heroku.

**Thoughts:** I felt like to start this journal thing days ago, but now, starting this, it feels good.
